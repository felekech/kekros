        text:'Our research also shows that this finding is not a statistical outlier. No other country in Western Europe has experienced as much serious right-wing violence since 1990 as Germany. German right-wing extremists have killed at least 121 people in the years since reunification. The comparison is particularly significant: there were 80 deaths in Norway during the same period (77 of them as a result of the Utøya attack ), 36 in Great Britain and 22 in Spain. In line with the prevailing trend in recent years, particularly in the case of attacks with a fatal outcome, the most common type of perpetrator in Germany is the so-called individual perpetrator. This type of perpetrator prepares attacks on their own and on their own initiative, which makes their prevention difficult. However, many of these perpetrators are only in a relative sense alone . They are often inspired by other assassins such as Brenton Tarrant, who killed 51 Muslims in Christchurch in New Zealand. In some cases, so-called individual perpetrators have been members of or associated with groups such as the neo-fascist CasaPound in Italy or the Reich Citizens Movement, which the German authorities classify as a separate form of extremism.'
